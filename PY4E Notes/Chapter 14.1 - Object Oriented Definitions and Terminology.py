# An Object is a bit of self-contained Code or Data

# Class - A template
# Defines the characteristics of a thing, including the thing's characteristics (attributes) and the thing's behaviors
# (the methods). A class is like a blueprint or a factory for an object.
# Example: the Dog class would consist of common traits (breed, fur color) and actions (bark, sit).

# Method or Message - A defined capability of a class
# An object's abilities. Methods would be the verbs. Using a method usually only affects one particular object, the one
# that the method is called on.
# Example: the Dog class could have a bark(), sit(), eat(), or walk() method.

# Field or Attribute - A bit of data in a class

# Object/Instance - A particular instance of a class
# You can have an instance of a class or a particular object. The instance is the actual object created at runtime.
# The set of values of the attributes of an object is called its state. The object consists of state and the behavior
# defined in the class.
