#Searching a String

#Search and Replace
greet = "Hello Bob"

#Stripping Whitespace
#.lstrip() and .rstrip() remove whitespace at the left or right
#.strip() removes both beginning and ending whitespace

#Prefixes
line = "Please have a nice day"
line.startswith("Please") #returns True
line.startswith("p") #returns False

#Parsing and Extracting
data = "From stephen.marquard@utc.ac.za Sat Jun 5 09:14:16 2008"
atpos = data.find("@") #atpos holds a value of 21, the location of the @ in the string
sppos = data.find(" ", atpos) #finds the index of the FIRST space AFTER the second parameter, ATPOS... sppos holds a value of 31
host = data[atpos+1 : sppos] #slices the string from 1 after the @ to the first space. HOLDS A VALUE OF "utc.ac.za"
